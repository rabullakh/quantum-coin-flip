# Quantum Coin Flip Simulation ğŸª™

This project simulates a **quantum coin flip** using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), a quantum machine learning library. It demonstrates how a single qubit in superposition can be used to generate probabilistic outcomesâ€”similar to flipping a fair coin.

## ğŸ§ª How It Works

The simulation performs the following steps:

1. Creates a quantum device with 1 qubit and 1000 shots.
2. Applies a Hadamard gate to create a superposition (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ©) / âˆš2.
3. Measures the qubit using the Pauli-Z observable.
4. Maps +1 â†’ 0 (heads) and -1 â†’ 1 (tails).
5. Displays the outcome frequencies in a bar chart.

## ğŸ“¦ Requirements

Make sure to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pennylane matplotlib
